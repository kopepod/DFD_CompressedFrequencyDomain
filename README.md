This is the implementation of the project entitled _Video Injection Attacks for Face Biometric Systems_ hosted at the Alan Turing Institute this repository is divided as follows:

1. Create Environment
2. Datasets
3. Training
4. Testing

## 1. Create Environment

To create the environment you have to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and run the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
You should be able to run this command:
```bash
conda run -n bayesianfusion python --version
```
## 2. Datasets


```bash
tree
.
└── DeepFakes

```

## 3. Training


## 4. Testing
